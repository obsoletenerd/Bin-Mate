# Bin Mate
## by BallaratMade

Bin Mate is a multi-MCU (ESP32, RPi Pico, more soon) bin reminder. Initially for Ballarat in Victoria AU but hopefully rolling out to more cities soon. It is an open sourcesoftware/hardware project connecting to local council APIs to remind you which bins to put out on which days.
